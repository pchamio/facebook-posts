    "<h3>Elegance of Graphics (2 marks)</h3>\n",
    "To ensure your graphics are of a high enough quality to receive the marks for elegance of graphics, please do one of the following:\n",

    "* Draw your graphs by hand, very neatly and with a ruler\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Code Quality (3 marks)</h3>\n",
    "To ensure your code is of a high enough quality to receive the marks for code quality, please ensure the following conditions are met:\n",
    "* Your code does not take too long to run (if a cell takes more than a minute to run, it takes too long UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED)\n",
    "* No trivial optimisations are missing from the code - we don't expect perfection but if something is blatantly written in a very sub-optimal way we might dock code quality marks for this\n",

    "<h2>Bonus Marks</h2>\n",
    "For this assignment, there are several bonus marks available\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Use of Markdown/LaTeX (2 marks)</h3>\n",
    "Although we do not require that you use Markdown/LaTeX for this assignment, we have assigned 2 bonus marks to encourage you to try this. Markdown/LaTeX is a great skill to have up your sleeve when you're working on maths or trying to share your work with other people.\n",
    "To receive one bonus mark, you must use Markdown/LaTeX for a majority of the questions in this assignment (at least 3). To receive two bonus marks, you must use Markdown/LaTeX for all of the questions in this assignment, where appropriate (i.e. except when code is required instead, of course).\n",

From our many tests with the original method, we know that the mean warping measurement for the original printing method is very close to 0.1mm (so we will use that as our estimate for the mean of the original population).\n",

To do this, we could just calculate the mean of each dataset's measurements and compare that to the 0.1mm mean of the original method, but this does not take into account the variance introduced by sampling from the population. Instead, we will use hypothesis testing.\n",

    "<h2>Question 2.a (5 marks)</h2>\n",
    "Before we can use our dataset, we need to preprocess it to make it suitable for use in a logistic regression. At the moment, our dataset consists of four variables. The accuracy and material variables are categorical, so we will need to convert them to factors (technically, success is also categorical, but leaving it as 0 or 1 is ok here because we don't need to do one-hot encoding on binary variables - it would just revert to the same variable anyway due to our avoidance of the dummy variable trap, as discussed below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, because accuracy and material are categorical (and not just discrete), we need to perform \"one-hot encoding\" on these variables. One-hot encoding (referred to as \"indicator variables\" in the lectures - see slide 41 in week 8's lecture notes) is the process of taking a categorical feature (with $k$ possible values it can take) and converting it to a set of $k$ binary values (in practice we use $k-1$, to avoid the \"dummy variable trap\"). It is important to do this because, when categorical variables are encoded as a single integer (e.g. \"red\" = 1, \"green\" = 2, \"blue\" = 3, ...), a logistic regression (and many other modelling techniques) will fit the feature as though \"red\" is closer to \"green\" than it is to \"blue\" (since 1 is closer to 2 than to 3). So, we split the values up into individual variables to avoid this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, R's built-in logistic regression automatically performs one-hot encoding on factor variables prior to running the algorithm (but we're going to ignore that and implement the encoding ourselves instead). To learn more about one-hot encoding, Wikipedia has a good page on it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics) (note that this technique goes by several names, including one-hot encoding, dummy variables, indicator variables, and a few others listed on the Wikipedia page).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform one-hot encoding, we take the dataset and, for each column we wish to encode:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Find how many different values the factor variable can take, using the levels() function; call this number $k$\n",
    " - Create $k-1$ new columns in the data-frame, corresponding to each level of the factor. For each row, set the value to 1 if the original variable's value corresponded to the column, and 0 otherwise. If the variable took the last value of the factor (the $k$-th value), just set them all to 0. We use $k-1$ columns to avoid the \"dummy variable trap\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics))\n",
    " - Don't forget to delete the original factor column from the data frame when you're done\n",
    "\n",
    "So, prepare our dataset as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Write a function to.factors, which takes the variables listed below and returns a data-frame identical to df, except that the columns listed in col.names have been converted to factor columns\n",
    "     - df is a data frame for which we wish to convert some variables to factors\n",
    "     - col.names is a vector of strings, where eahc string corresponds to the name of a column in the data-frame which we want to convert to a factor column using the to.factor() function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Write a function one.hot.encode, which takes two variables (df and to.encode) and returns a data-frame identical to df, except that the factor columns listed in to.encode have been replaced with one-hot encoding columns as described above\n",
    "     - df is a data frame which we wish to apply one-hot encoding to\n",
    "     - to.encode is a vector of strings, where each string corresponds to the name of a column in the data-frame which we want to convert from a factor column to a one-hot encoding\n",
